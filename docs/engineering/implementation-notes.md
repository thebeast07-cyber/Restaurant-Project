# Implementation Notes

Living notes on what's actually been built, how it works, and gotchas hit along the
way — for whoever joins this codebase next (including future-us).

- **What this is not**: a restatement of the plan. See
  [`docs/architecture/01-mvp-technical-design.md`](../architecture/01-mvp-technical-design.md)
  for the intended design. This file tracks reality — what landed, what changed from
  plan, and what surprised us.
- **How to use it**: skim "Current State" first, then jump to the module section
  you're touching. Read "Gotchas" before you hit the same bug we already fixed.

## Current State

Sprint day: **8 / 14** (see technical design doc for the full day-by-day plan).
**Walking skeleton milestone reached** (Day 4): Order → Checkout → Inventory deducted
via Recipe → balanced Finance journal posted, all in one atomic transaction. Verified
down to raw SQL, not just API responses. **Day 5**: stress-tested the concurrent paths
and found + fixed 2 real race conditions (see Concurrency section below) — this is the
part of the codebase with the most scrutiny so far.

**Explicit decision after Day 3**: backend-first. Everything built so far is API-only,
tested via `curl`/integration tests — no frontend exists yet. UI is a deliberately
separate block of work, not interleaved per day as the original sprint table implied.

Done: Identity/Auth, multi-tenant isolation, Catalog + Recipe, Table/Shift/Order (cart),
Payment (Cash + QRIS-manual), Inventory deduction, Finance journal (background, no UI),
station ticket routing/formatting (content only — no physical printer wired yet,
pending hardware confirmation), full table occupancy lifecycle (Available <-> Occupied,
concurrency-safe).
Not started: physical printer integration, Void, Shift close, Reporting, any UI.

## Running Locally

```bash
docker compose up -d                       # Postgres
export PATH="$HOME/.dotnet:$PATH"          # .NET SDK is user-local, not system-wide
cd src/Restaurant.Api && dotnet run        # applies migrations + seeds data automatically
```

API listens on `http://localhost:5291` (see `Properties/launchSettings.json`).
Seeded dev-only accounts: `owner` / `Owner#12345`, `manager` / `Manager#12345`,
`cashier` / `Cashier#12345` (passwords are local test data, not real secrets).

To wipe and reseed (e.g. after a schema change during dev): `docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d`,
then run the Api again — migrations + seed re-apply from scratch since the DB is gone.

## Solution Structure

```
Restaurant.Domain          — entities only, no EF/ASP.NET dependency. Organized by
                              bounded context folder (Organization, Identity, Catalog,
                              Sales, ...), not by technical layer.
Restaurant.Infrastructure   — AppDbContext, EF Core migrations, tenant query filter.
Restaurant.Api              — controllers, auth (JWT), DI wiring (Program.cs), seed data.
Restaurant.Tests            — not populated yet (xUnit scaffold only).
```

Dependency direction: `Api → Infrastructure → Domain`, and `Api → Domain` directly for
types. `Domain` depends on nothing — this is intentional (see architecture doc §14
"Simplicity for a Small Team" / Clean Architecture boundary).

## Multi-Tenancy

Every entity that implements `ITenantScoped` (or `IBranchScoped`, which extends it)
automatically gets `WHERE TenantId = @current` appended by EF Core's Global Query
Filter — see `AppDbContext.ApplyTenantQueryFilters()`. This is reflection-based: it
scans the model for any CLR type implementing `ITenantScoped` and builds the filter
expression generically, so **new entities get tenant isolation for free just by
implementing the interface** — no per-entity wiring needed in `OnModelCreating`.

`ICurrentTenantProvider.TenantId == null` bypasses the filter entirely. This is only
ever true for two trusted contexts: `SystemTenantProvider` (migrations/seeding) and
`HttpCurrentTenantProvider` when there's no authenticated user (e.g. the login
endpoint itself, before we know who the user is). **Never** make this reachable from
an authenticated request path.

## Module Notes

### Identity & Auth
- 3 fixed roles (`Owner`, `Manager`, `Cashier`) as an enum, not a Role/Permission
  table — custom RBAC builder is explicitly out of scope for the MVP.
- JWT claims: `sub` (UserId), `name`, `role`, `tenant_id`, `branch_id`.
- Login looks up `User` by `Username` alone (not tenant-scoped) — fine with exactly
  one seeded Tenant. **Breaks** the moment a second Tenant exists; needs a tenant
  selector (subdomain/org code) before that happens. Flagged in code as a comment on
  `AuthController.Login`.

### Catalog
- `Product` never holds stock. It's linked to `Ingredient` (the actual stock unit) via
  `RecipeItem`. This was a deliberate correction mid-planning — see design doc for the
  reasoning (a menu item like "Nasi Goreng" isn't a warehouse item; rice/egg/chicken
  are).
- `Station` (Kitchen/Bar) is a plain enum field on `Product`, not a separate table —
  routing logic elsewhere reads this, no hardcoded per-product branching.

### Sales (Order/Shift/Table)
- `Shift` is intentionally minimal right now — open only, no close/reconciliation yet
  (that's Day 11). But `Order.ShiftId` is required (not nullable), so a cashier must
  open a shift before creating any order. This coupling was a deliberate choice made
  during Day 3 rather than deferring it, to avoid retrofitting `Order` later.
- `Order.Status` starts at `Draft` and stays there through item add/remove — the
  transition to `Open` happens at "send to station" (Day 7, not built yet).
- `RestaurantTable` is a full table (not shared with anything SQL-related); named
  `RestaurantTable` instead of `Table` specifically to avoid confusion with SQL/EF
  terminology in code reviews.
- `Order.Status` goes straight from `Draft`/`Open` to `Completed` on successful
  checkout — there's no separately-persisted `Paid` state even though the enum has
  one. The design doc's flow sketch describes Paid → Completed as two steps, but
  nothing in the MVP scope differentiates them (no "mark as served" action exists),
  so persisting both would just be dead state. Revisit if that changes.

### Payment / Inventory / Finance (Day 4 — walking skeleton)
- `OrdersController.Checkout` is the `OrderPaid` event handler, implemented as a
  single in-process method (not a message/broker) wrapped in one explicit DB
  transaction: deduct stock (atomic per-Ingredient, see Concurrency section below) →
  write StockMovement audit rows → record Payment → post journal → complete order →
  commit. If any Ingredient is short, the transaction rolls back — no partial
  deduction, verified at the DB level, not just via the API response.
- Journal posts a simple Cash/Revenue pair only — **no COGS/InventoryAsset lines**.
  That needs a per-Ingredient unit cost, which isn't modeled yet (`Ingredient` has no
  cost field). This is a known, deliberate gap, not an oversight — flagged again here
  so it doesn't get silently assumed "done" later.
- Cash and QRIS both post to the same `"1000" Cash` account for now — there's no
  separate bank/e-wallet clearing account because neither goes through a real payment
  gateway yet.
- Enums are serialized as strings in JSON now (`"Cash"`, `"Kitchen"`, `"Completed"`),
  not raw ints — added `JsonStringEnumConverter` globally in `Program.cs` while
  building this. Applies retroactively to every endpoint, not just Payment/Checkout.

### QRIS (Day 6)
Required **zero code changes**. `Checkout` already took a generic `PaymentMethodCode`
and looked up the matching seeded `PaymentMethod` row — QRIS was already in that enum
and seeded from Day 4, just unverified until now. Tested end-to-end (`paymentMethod:
"Qris"`) and confirmed correct in the DB (payment row, balanced journal).

This matches the "QRIS statis, tanpa gateway" decision made earlier: the QR code
itself is a physical/pre-existing asset the merchant already owns, not something the
system generates per-transaction — so there's no "initiate payment, wait for webhook,
then confirm" flow to build. The cashier shows the static QR, verifies payment
happened by eye, then presses what is mechanically the same "Checkout" action as Cash.
If/when a real QRIS gateway integration replaces this (fast-follow, needs a vendor
decision — see PRD §24), that's an *additive* change: a new async confirmation path
alongside this one, not a rewrite of it.

### Station Ticket Routing (Day 7)
- New endpoint `POST /api/orders/{id}/send-to-station`: locks the cart (atomic
  Draft→Open claim, same guarded-transition pattern as Checkout's Order claim — two
  concurrent calls must not both succeed, or the kitchen gets duplicate tickets), then
  groups `OrderItem`s by `Station` and formats one ticket per station.
- `StationTicketFormatter` (in `Restaurant.Api/Printing/`) is pure text formatting with
  **zero dependency on an actual printer**. It returns ticket content as strings in the
  API response; nothing is sent to hardware. Tested: a 2-item order (1 Kitchen, 1 Bar
  product) correctly produces exactly 2 tickets, each listing only its own items.
- **Blocked on hardware**: wiring this content to a real thermal printer needs a
  confirmed physical unit + connection type. Unit is available, but **Bluetooth is
  ruled out on the dev machine (Fedora Linux, no working BT stack for this)**. Waiting
  on which of LAN/Ethernet (preferred — raw ESC/POS over a TCP socket to port 9100,
  no special driver needed, and works the same if the server later moves off this
  machine) or USB (works, but ties the printer to whichever machine physically runs
  the API) the unit actually supports, plus the model name. `StationTicketFormatter`
  itself won't need to change either way — only the adapter that consumes its output.
- Checkout still accepts an order in `Draft` (never sent to station) or `Open` (sent)
  — sending to station isn't a prerequisite for payment in this implementation, only
  a prerequisite for the kitchen/bar knowing what to prepare.

### Table Occupancy (Day 8)
- `RestaurantTable.Status` is now actually maintained, not just a schema field nobody
  touched: `OrdersController.Create` atomically claims it (`Available` → `Occupied`,
  same `ExecuteUpdateAsync`-with-WHERE pattern as every other claim in this codebase)
  when a `TableId` is given, and `Checkout` releases it back to `Available`
  unconditionally once the order completes — safe because `Create`'s claim guarantees
  only one Order can ever hold a given Table at a time, so there's nothing to check
  before releasing it.
- Verified with a dedicated stress test (`TableClaimRaceTests`): 15 concurrent
  "create order for table X" requests, exactly 1 succeeds, table ends up `Occupied`
  (not double-booked). This one passed on the first run — built the atomic claim in
  from the start this time instead of retrofitting it after a failing test, applying
  the lesson from Day 5/7 directly.
- **Void isn't built yet (Day 9)** — when it is, it also needs to release the table
  (same as Checkout does), or a voided order would leave its table stuck `Occupied`
  forever with no order actually using it.

### Concurrency
- "At most one open Shift per user" is enforced by a **partial unique index**
  (`shifts (UserId) WHERE Status = 0`), not just the `AnyAsync` check in
  `ShiftsController.Open`. The application-level check alone is check-then-insert and
  race-prone; verified with 5 concurrent open-shift requests for the same user — the
  DB constraint let exactly 1 through and the other 4 got a clean `409`, not a crash.
  This is the pattern to follow for any other "at most one X" invariant going forward
  (don't trust an `AnyAsync` check alone under concurrency — back it with a DB
  constraint and catch `DbUpdateException` to turn the violation into a clean 4xx).

- **Stock deduction is an atomic conditional `UPDATE` per Ingredient, not
  read-modify-write.** The first version of `Checkout` read `Stock.Quantity`, computed
  the new value in C#, and wrote it back via the normal change tracker — the textbook
  lost-update race. A stress test (`StockRaceConditionTests`, see `tests/`) fired 20
  concurrent checkouts against 5 units of stock: **all 20 "succeeded"**, massively
  overselling, with zero errors anywhere — this is the dangerous kind of bug, since
  nothing looks wrong until someone reconciles stock later. Fixed by replacing the
  read-then-write with
  `_db.Stocks.Where(s => s.IngredientId == id && s.Quantity >= required).ExecuteUpdateAsync(...)`
  inside an explicit transaction: this is a single atomic SQL statement, so Postgres
  row-locks the matched row for its duration — a concurrent request re-evaluates
  `Quantity >= required` against the value just written, never a stale read. If 0 rows
  are affected, that Ingredient was short (checked without a separate read
  beforehand). Re-ran the same stress test after the fix: exactly 5 of 20 succeed, the
  rest get a clean `400`, final stock is exactly 0, never negative.
  **Pattern to reuse anywhere else in this codebase that decrements a shared
  counter/quantity under potential concurrency**: never "SELECT then subtract then
  SAVE" — use a conditional `ExecuteUpdateAsync` (or raw atomic SQL) and check rows
  affected instead.
- A second stress test (`CheckoutLoadTests`) covers the complementary failure mode:
  plentiful stock, 50 genuinely concurrent full checkout flows, asserting the **exact**
  final quantity (not just "no errors") — a lost update here would under-deduct
  silently while every request still reports `200 OK`. Also passes post-fix.
- **A third, independent race: two concurrent checkouts on the SAME order.** The stock
  fix above says nothing about whether the *Order* itself can be checked out twice —
  it only guards the Ingredient quantity. Wrote a targeted follow-up stress test
  (`OrderCheckoutRaceTests`) that fires 10 concurrent checkout calls at one Order: all
  10 "succeeded" before the fix — 10x Payment, 10x JournalEntry, 10x stock deduction
  for what should be a single sale. Fixed the same way as the stock race: atomically
  claim the Order via
  `_db.Orders.Where(o => o.Id == orderId && (Status == Draft || Status == Open)).ExecuteUpdateAsync(SetProperty(o => o.Status, Completed))`
  as the very first write inside the transaction, checking rows-affected, before any
  stock/payment/journal work happens. Only the request that wins the claim proceeds;
  everyone else gets a clean 400 immediately. Re-verified 3x for stability: exactly 1
  of 10 succeeds every time.
  - **Follow-on bug this fix introduced, caught by manual smoke test (not the stress
    test)**: `ExecuteUpdateAsync` writes directly to the DB and bypasses EF Core's
    change tracker, so the `Order` instance already loaded earlier in the same request
    keeps its stale pre-checkout `Status` in memory. `BuildOrderResponse` then
    re-queried on the *same* `DbContext`, and EF's identity map handed back that
    already-tracked (stale) instance instead of re-reading the column — so a
    successful checkout's response reported `"status": "Draft"` even though the DB
    correctly said `Completed`. Fixed with `.AsNoTracking()` on the query in
    `BuildOrderResponse`. **Lesson**: after any `ExecuteUpdateAsync`/raw SQL mutation
    within a request, don't trust a tracked re-query on the same context to reflect
    it — use `AsNoTracking()` (or re-attach/reload explicitly) for anything read back
    afterward.

## Gotchas (bugs already hit — read before you hit them again)

### JWT `sub` claim silently disappears
ASP.NET Core's `JwtBearerHandler` remaps short claim types (`sub`, `role`, ...) to
long XML-schema URIs by default when validating an incoming token
(`ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier` instead of `"sub"`). If you read claims back with
`JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Sub`, you'll get nothing and it'll look like the claim was
never issued. **Fix applied**: `options.MapInboundClaims = false;` in the JwtBearer
setup in `Program.cs`. If you ever see `"Token has no sub claim"` despite the token
clearly having one (check on jwt.io), this is almost certainly why.

### Adding a child entity to an already-tracked parent's collection doesn't reliably mark it `Added`
When you load a tracked entity (e.g. `Order` via `.Include(o => o.Items)`) and then do
`order.Items.Add(newItem)`, EF Core does **not** reliably detect `newItem` as a new row
to insert. In our case it generated an `UPDATE order_items ... WHERE Id = @id` for a
row that didn't exist yet, which naturally affected 0 rows and threw
`DbUpdateConcurrencyException`. This only bites when the *parent* was already tracked
(fetched from DB) before the child was added — it does **not** happen when the parent
itself is newly `Add()`-ed in the same operation (e.g. `Product` + its `RecipeItems` on
creation work fine, because `Product` is new too and EF cascades `Added` state through
the whole graph from the root).

**Fix**: add the child explicitly to its own `DbSet` (`_db.OrderItems.Add(item)`)
instead of relying on collection-navigation fixup to mark it `Added`.

**Related trap**: once you do that, EF Core's relationship fixup *also* auto-appends
the item into `order.Items` in memory (because the FK now matches a tracked parent).
If you *also* manually call `order.Items.Add(item)` "to be safe", the item ends up
**twice** in the in-memory collection (same object reference, so same `Id` shown
twice in any response built from it) — and anything summing over `order.Items` (like
`RecalculateTotal()`) double-counts it. Only one of the two `.Add()` calls is ever
needed; use the explicit `DbSet.Add()` and let fixup handle the navigation.

## Fast-follow (deferred, tracked so nothing gets silently forgotten)

See `docs/architecture/01-mvp-technical-design.md` §"Scope Recap" for the full list.
Two worth calling out here because they're partial/coupled to what's built:
- Login-by-username-only breaks with a second Tenant (see Identity notes above).
- `Shift` close/reconciliation UI doesn't exist — a shift can be opened but never
  closed yet.
